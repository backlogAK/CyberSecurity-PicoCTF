5.  $ pwd  ---> Print the name of current directory.
6.  $ rm -rf ---> Delete all files in current directory.
7.  To delete a single file, use the rm or unlink command followed by the file name:
       
        --> $ unlink Ayush.txt
        --> $ rm Ayush.txt       ***** Both of this used to delete single file using name **********
        
        --> If the file is write-protected, you will be prompted for confirmation, as shown below. To remove the file type y, and hit Enter. 
             Otherwise, if the file is not write-protected, it will be deleted without prompting.
             
    To delete multiple files at once, use the rm command followed by the file names separated by space:
    
        --> $ rm Ayush1.txt Ayush2.txt Ayush3.txt
        
    You can also use a wildcard (*) and regular expansions to match multiple files. 
    For example, to remove all .pdf files in the current directory, use the following command: 
    
        --> $ rm *.pdf
        
    Use the rm with the -i option to confirm each file before deleting it:
    
        --> $ rm -i filename(s)
        
     To remove files without prompting, even if the files are write-protected, pass the -f (force) option to the rm command:
     
        --> $ rm -f filename(s)
        
     You can also combine rm options. For example, to remove all .txt files in the current directory without a prompt in verbose mode, use the following command:
      
        --> $ rm -fv *.txt
        
6. How to Remove Directories (Folders):
      In Linux, you can remove/delete directories with the rmdir and rm. 
      
      To remove an empty directory, use either rmdir or rm -d followed by the directory name:
        
        --> $ rm -d dirname
        --> $ rmdir dirname     ******* Both of them used to delete empty directory *******
        
      To remove non-empty directories and all the files within them, use the rm command with the-r (recursive) option:
      
        --> $ rm -r dirname
        
      Same as with files, you can also use a wildcard (*) and regular expansions to match multiple directories.

--> Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. Specifically, 
       it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images. Binwalk uses the libmagic library, 
       so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix file utility.
